# Simple Value Converter
This is a simple application to convert currency. It's made for demo only.
The source code is public and you can use it to extend or improve the software.

Created by me (Francesco Florio) on December 20, 2016.
Special thanks to http://free.currencyconverterapi.com to provide the free API used in the App.

If you don't want to build the code, you can download and try the App directly from:
